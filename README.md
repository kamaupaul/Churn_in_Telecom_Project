# Churn_in_Telecom_Project
Reducing Customer Churn using Predictive Modeling

# Overview 
SyriaTel Mobile Telcom is a provider of mobile telecommunication and data services based in Damascus, Syria. The company offers services including calls, news, message, GSM and internet services, thereby making the life of customers easier with reasonable prices.

Telecom industry is a very competitive market, these idustries like SyriaTel expirience an average of 15%-25% annual churn rate. 
Churn has strong impact on the life time value of the customer because it affects the length of service and the future revenue of the company.
Telecom companies spend hundreds of dollars to acquire a new customer and when that customer leaves, the company not only loses the future revenue from that customer but also the resources spend to acquire that customer.

To reduce churn rate the company aims to predict any potential churners in advance and take appropriate measures to ensure reduction of churn rate.
This project aims to build predictive models to identify potential churners in advance.

When the customer has stopped using the service for a while it maybe too late to retain them, customers do not instantly decide to switch to another competitor rather they take sometime to decide, hence by detecting them before they decide we can potentially reduce the future churn rate.

# Business Understanding

The primary objective of any business is to reduce customer churn. By identifying potential churners in advance, the company can take precaution measures to retain these customers.

Such measures may include:

- Improved customer service.

- Addressing the issues that may lead to churn.

- Making targeted offers and,

- Targeted market campaigns among others.
Churn can have great significant financial impact on the business as high churn leads to loss of recurring revenue, damage of brand's reputation among many other effects.

This project aims to predict customer churn by developing an algorithm to predict the churn rate based on customer usage pattern.

# Data Understanding

The dataset has customer usage pattern and whether the customer has churned or not. I will develop an algorithm to predict the churn score based on usage pattern. The predictors provided are as follows:

- account length

- international plan

- voice mail plan

- number of voice mail messages

- total day minutes used

- day calls made

- total day charge

- total evening minutes

- total evening calls

- total evening charge

- total night minutes

- total night calls

- total night charge

- total international minutes used

- total international calls made

- total international charge

- number customer service calls made

Target Variable is:

Churn: if the customer has churned (1=yes; 0 = no)
The dataset contains customer-level information for a span of four consecutive months - June, July, August and September. The months are encoded as 6, 7, 8 and 9, respectively.
